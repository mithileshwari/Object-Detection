# Object-Detection
*  Created an Object Detection Classifier that can quickly and accurately detect men and women outfits into different categories.
* Different object detection models - Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN of TensorFlow were trained and evaluated. The final model-Faster RCNN had a test accuracy of 87% and speed 620 ms.
# Code 
* Object_detection_image.py, Object_detection_video.py contains code of bounding box construction on an image and video respectively.
# Result 
* Result[1-3].jpg shows the result obtained on image and video frames.
